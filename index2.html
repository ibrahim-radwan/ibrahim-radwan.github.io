            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am an active researcher in fields of Computer Vision and Image Understanding. I am passionate about designing and developing systems that automatically learn to recognize and interact in complex environments. My work aims to automatically understand and analyze human behavior as part of AI and as a critical factor in reaching a digital evolution in computational modeling. With years of experience spanning academia and industry, I've excelled as an educator at various universities. As a teacher, I've imparted knowledge to Ph.D./MSc/B.S. students, cultivating the next generation of talent. Additionally, I've built and led research groups, exceeding expectations, and managing diverse professionalsâ€”software developers, interns, and research assistants. My expertise extends to conceiving, pitching, and delivering computer vision and machine learning projects to both corporate and government clients. I've contributed directly to product development across a spectrum of applications, leveraging my analytical skills. In the dual roles of teacher, researcher, and hands-on contributor, I consistently generate value and meaningful results in complex environments.</p>
